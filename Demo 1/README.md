# Demo 1

### Purpose
There are three main tasks that should be completed for Demo 1. A robot will be created which, using computer vision, can determine the angle between a blue piece of tape and the center axis of the camera. For the second task, the robot will receive a distance to drive forward. It must take these directions and translate them to motion and stop as close as possible to the desired set point. For the final task, the robot will receive both an angle and a distance. It will then rotate to th desired angle and then drive forward the specified distance.
